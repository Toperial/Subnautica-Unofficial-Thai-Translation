	"TerrainSystemInformationHeader": "Terrain System Information",
	"TerrainSystemInformationText": "Subnautica uses a voxel terrain system that stores information in batches. Each batch is a 160m wide cube, and the world is made up of about 12,500 of them.

The development team is constantly working on these batches. New caves are carved, ravines cut out, Kelp Forests planted, and rock formations sculpted.

Subnautica is updated frequently. If Experimental branch is played, it is updated three times per day! Saved games need to work across multiple game versions. Otherwise, as soon as the development team released an update, the saved game would be lost.

Most saved game information can survive an update. For example, an inventory containing two oxygen tanks can survive if a new type of craftable diving suit is added to the game.

Other information can't survive an update. For example, suppose a seabase is built on a cliff, and suppose the development team works on the batch containing that cliff, raising the cliff height.

If that save game is loaded, the seabase will be stuck inside the cliff. Not only will the base be inaccessible, but the player might be stuck in there too, and all hell will break loose inside Subnautica's game logic.

To solve this problem, every saved game retains its own copy of terrain data. This data stores the world as it was when that game was started, along with any modifications made by a player (For example, digging sand to create a cave).

As new updates are released, the saved game receives new features, items, creatures, and so on. But it never receives new terrain. This is often ok. In the case of major updates, it is not.

New game systems and items included in this update depend on the data contained in new terrain batches. If a an old saved game tries to play current version, it will not work properly and might even crash Subnautica completely.

This is why old saved games must be upgraded to play the game. Therefore some terrain batches are forced to update, allowing the new update to function. Any stuff (such as seabases) placed in these batches is destroyed by this process, to avoid the stuck-in-a-cliff scenario described above.

However, the upgrade is not perfect. Depending on specific circumstances, it is possible that gaps could open up in terrain, or systems fail to function perfectly. In addition, the ugprade does not include all the new terrain data from the rest of the world.

 To play with an entirely up to date world, it is necessary to start a new game. The choice is yours. Regardless of your choice, thank you for participating in Subnautica Early Access. You are quite literally watching an alien ocean world grow before your eyes. This saved game upgrade process is a prime example of that growth.",

	"MinSpecAnswer0": "Can I run Subnautica on a different computer?

Yes. You can run Subnautica on any computer on which your Steam account is logged in. Subnautica is tied to a Steam account, not a particular computer.",
	"MinSpecAnswer1": "Can I get a refund? My computer does not meet these requirements.

Because Subnautica is sold via Steam, Steam has absolute and sole discretion over the issue of refunds. Unknown Worlds cannot issue refunds, or intervene on your behalf with Steam.",
	"MinSpecAnswer2": "How was I supposed to know about these requirements?

Subnautica has minimum and recommended system requirements listed on its Steam Store page.",
	"MinSpecAnswer3": "Are these system requirements really high?

Subnautica's minumum system requirements are not high. The minimum GPU requirement is less powerful than what is found in a modern game console.",
	"MinSpecAnswer4": "What happens if I try to play Subnautica despite this warning?

Subnautica might run just fine. It might crash as soon as it tries to load the game world. We're not sure what exactly will happen for individual cases, but it is very likely Subnautica will run slowly and / or crash.",
	"MinSpecAnswer5": "Will these system requirements ever drop?

It is unlikely Subnautica's minimum system requirements will drop lower than they are at present.",
	"MinSpecMemoryInfoHeader": "More info - Memory",
	"MinSpecMemoryInfoText": "Computers generally have two types of memory - Volatile memory, commonly called Random Access Memory (RAM), and non-volatile memory in the form of disk drives.

Disk drives store files and folders, and RAM stores what a computer is thinking about. Subnautica needs four gigabytes (GB) of RAM to be able to think about all the creatures, terrain, physics, and gameplay found in the game world. Without 4 GB of RAM, Subnautica can't think properly, and will crash. 

It is not possible to get more RAM using software tools. Freeing space on your disk drive by deleting files and folders will not make more RAM available. To get more RAM, it is necessary to install more or higher capacity RAM modules in your computer.

Depending on what type of computer you have, this may or may not be possible. For example, it is often very hard to install more RAM in a laptop. You may be able to contact your computer manufacturer and ask them if it is possible to upgrade your computer.

If you would like to learn more about RAM, and how to get more of it, try opening a discussion on the Steam forums. Other players may be able to help you!",
	"MinSpecOpenSteamForums": "Open Steam Forums",
	"MinSpecRAMDetected": "RAM detected:",
	"MinSpecGPUInfoHeader": "More info - GPU",
	"MinSpecGPUInfoText": "Computers use Graphics Processing Units (GPU) to turn information about Subnautica's game world into pixels that you can see on your screen. They are often known as 'Graphics Cards.'

It is hard to define exactly what type of GPU is required to run Subnautica, because they come in many different varieties, and are identified with many different brand names.

Generally, a GPU that scores more than 950 points in the 3DMark Firestrike benchmark test will be capable of running Subnautica with minimum graphics settings, at a resolution of 1280 x 720.

If Subnautica has detected that your GPU is not powerful enough, you may still be able to play. However, your frame-rate (the speed at which the game runs) may be very poor. Depending on the type of computer you have, you may be able to upgrade your GPU.

To find out more about GPUs, and to determine if this computer's GPU can be upgraded, try opening a discussion thread on the Steam forums.",
	"MinSpecGPUDetected": "GPU Detected:",
	"MinSpecCPUInfoHeader": "More info - CPU",
	"MinSpecCPUInfoText": "Central Processing Units (CPUs) make calculations that determine what is going on in Subnautica's game world. For example, they calculate the buoyancy of the Life Pod, and the position of each individual Peeper fish.

CPUs think in 'threads,' which are like 'trains of thought.' The number of thoughts that a CPU can think at once is determined by the number of logical processors it has.

CPUs can have multiple logical processors by having more than one 'core' - a piece of hardware that executes threads. They can split those cores into multiple threads. For example, many Intel CPUs use a technique called 'Hyper Threading.'

However the CPU goes about having more than one logical processor, Subnautica needs at least two of them to run properly. If this computer has less than two logical processors, it is very likely that it will run poorly and crash.

Sometimes CPUs can be upgraded. To determine if this computer can be upgraded, try opening a discussion thread on the Steam forums.",

The furthest reaches of inhabited space are due to expand, as Alterra Corp launches a newly-constructed capital ship, carrying a phasegate bound for the Ariadne Arm. 

The Aurora will travel from spacedock on the edge of Alterra space, making hundreds of consecutive phasegate jumps through nine different trans-gov authorities, and arrive on the far side of the Ariadne Arm in three months' time. From there the command crew will pilot the ship beyond the final phasegate, arriving in the next solar system approximately 18 months later.

There the elite team of engineers will begin a 6 month construction project on the new phasegate, a multi-trillion credit investment. In the absence of existing infrastructure in the region, the vessel is equipped with advanced thermal and nuclear power facilities.

Alterra Corp. currently operates 9% of all phasegates in the galaxy. If the Aurora's mission is successful Alterra will have outmaneuvered a cabal of Mongolian corporations, operating a range of outposts and mines in the region.",

 - The official supplier of the TSF
 - Consistently ranked amongst the Galaxy's best employers
 - Began life as a defense manufacturer in the mid-22nd century
 - National Motto/Slogan: 'Get what you deserve'
 
Although most trans-govs can trace their roots back to earth, Alterra - literally meaning 'by earth' - is the only one brazen enough to take its name. 

During the Expansion, Alterra supplied arms to all sides, acquiring and housing a vast colonist workforce, and making the transition from manufacturer to state. The corporation's threat to cease trade was one of the turning points in the conflict, bringing about the end of hostilities and the signing of the Charter.

Alterra holds the monopoly within its own borders. Free enterprise is encouraged; but competition is tight, all goods exported offworld must be Alterra branded, and profitable businesses are bought out by the state, owners ascending to the Alterra Board of Directors. Well-known Alterra technologies such as the Cyclops submersible originated with such private enterprise.

Despite superficial similarities to national governments, the corporation's lawyers have always maintained that it has no legal obligation to its 'employees', but voluntarily elects to take on the roles usually served by a democratically elected government. This claim has not yet been tested in Federation courts.",

All the good things in life are commodities. We trade love just as we buy and sell stock. We engage in human relationships when there is a fair exchange of value - be that support, motivation, challenge, learning - nothing good is ever for free.

If every physical good in the galaxy came from a single supplier, that would constitute a dangerous monopoly. Personal relationships are the same: it is important for people to get what they need from multiple sources. Further, if someone finds a better source of the goods they require, they should be free to add it to or replace their existing supplier. 

If one member of a relationship should feel threatened or jealous, they must look at their own business model and ask whether it is performing competitively. There is always room for improvement.",

"Ency_InnerBiomeWreckLore4" : "Alterra Citizen Testimonials",
"EncyDesc_InnerBiomeWreckLore4" : "Frank told us this: 'I hear there are worlds out there where kids still learn from books. They go into a classroom every day, they memorize things, then later they have to write those things down again in controlled environments. Or worlds where everyone's supposed to be an artist! What use is learning to draw to someone who's going to work in human resources? On Alterra worlds, psychometric testing and specialized digi-training makes the most of everyone's talents.'

Max Zoinkoff: 'I started out in marketing for Alterra Survival Systems. It was good work, but I thought I could do better. I set up my own company, developing bespoke code for the Seamoth submersible. I sold up to Alterra ten years ago. Now I'm on the board of directors, and I haven't looked back.'

George said, 'An average day for me starts at 10am. I live in a controlled habitat on Terra 17, so everything I need is less than five minutes away. I'm a naturally empathetic person, so I took work as a companion. I spend my days visiting clients, talking with them, learning about them, paying them the attention that everyone needs and deserves, and like most people on Alterra worlds I'm lucky enough to earn a living doing things I enjoy.'

Kaz says, 'We're lucky. We're free. We have jobs. There are trans-govs out there that do everything with robots, you know?'

Jamie had this to say: 'I design artificial worlds, including some of the most popular factory defaults. To do what I do you need to know what people really want. They want excitement, adventure, new experiences, to be whoever they want to be. My job is to make that happen. There are people who say we spend too much time escaping our lives and not enough time making them better. Those people are usually from outside of Alterra space.'",


    "Ency_InnerBiomeWreckLore5" : "Trans-Gov Profile: Mongolian Independent States",
"EncyDesc_InnerBiomeWreckLore5" : "When the hostilities of the Expansion ceased, the tactical value of a number of hard-to-reach colony systems on the outer rim of the China Territories plummeted. Recouping from the war, the central government left them to starve. The systems in question declared independence, claiming their infrastructure as their own, and their intent to become self-sufficient.

Today the Mongolian States is seen as a relatively minor power on the outskirts of colonized space, yet it remains one of the fastest expanding trans-govs in the galaxy. There is little centralized control. In times of war, a defense force can be raised between the chief officers of the major planetary corporations.

Mongolian societies inherited their technologies from the Chinese, but incorporated the customs of their multicultural colonist base. Non-synthetic foods remain popular. Religion is a strong component of society, but the Mongolians take a relaxed view of competing faiths, believing gods to be universally flawed, and equally defensible.",

"Ency_InnerBiomeWreckLore9" : "Unificationism",
"EncyDesc_InnerBiomeWreckLore9" : "Religion has been scorned throughout space-faring history, but it has survived. By combining ancient meditative practices with the foresight of modern science, unificationist pantheism was born.

Determinism teaches us that what has always been, always will be. The future is already decided, and free will is a myth. Gone are the days of casting guilt and original sin on all. Today we understand that we are born innocent, into lives we are not responsible for; we are atoms vibrating in the energy winds of space. Understanding that what we do has no meaning but for ourselves; and understanding that we are just as much a causal part of the universe as the universe is a causal part of us; we can understand that we give meaning to the universe and the universe gives meaning to us. We are people. But we are also gods.

If we are gods, why do we feel imperfect? If there is no authority but our own, why do people keep telling us what to do?

Unificationism has the answer. 300 credits for the opening seminar.",

Alterra Alms is a training academy for those in need. We're not a charity, because we don't ask for handouts - we prefer to think of ourselves as a philanthropic beneficence facilitation service promoting synergy between employer and workforce.

"EncyDesc_IslandsPDABase1Interior" : "Captain's log, five weeks since our ship, the Degasi, was shot down. I give thanks that fate saw fit to spare my son, Bart, and I from death, but my personal entourage were not so destined. The only other survivor was Marguerit Maida, a cut-price mercenary with local expertise who I reluctantly commissioned for the journey.

We spent days in the lifepods, rain beating on the roof, nothing but ocean on the horizon. Just as we were losing hope the weather cleared and we saw this island, this floating oasis. We were saved.

We salvaged the Degasi wreck down to its barebones and built this habitat from the scrap. I set Bart to studying the alien plantlife and arranging us a stable source of food, put that expensive digi-training to good use. People can question digi-training and foreign technology all they like. Bart's bio-chem imprint already paid for itself. As I dictate this I'm eating hydroponically-grown  potato salad garnished, with seeds that taste like spicy orange peel.

Our only problem is Maida. I've caught her muttering that the island's too small to support us indefinitely. That the weather's going to turn on us. I say she's grown superstitious. Every judgement she makes assumes things go from bad to worse, that the only forward is a fight. She ought to take in some context. As a species we've spent millenia learning how to shackle nature to our will. This planet won't cause us any new problems.

No wonder she was so interested last night to know what I'd learned about them.

Based on my wild theories about alien behaviour, she hand-fed an alien shark. She came home with a fresh cut on her forearm, didn't say anything about it of course, but I'd guess it took a couple of tries. She says once they're fed they're harmless. She brought home all the teeth we need.

On one hand, that is the most badass thing I ever heard, and now I'm sitting in this observatory watching biters tap harmlessly at the glass. On the other hand, how many of those incredible creatures did she have to kill just to tame one? What effects are we having on the ecosystem here?

Back on the island I wouldn't have believed the creatures that live down here. Marguerit has been bringing back the wildest specimens you could imagine. The fish down here, they GLOW. There's one that's 90% eyeball. Snakes the length of a whole corridor section.

OK, 99% of the plantlife is toxic, I learned that the hard way, but I've managed to coax some land plants into growing indoors, and when they don't cover it... well, we eat the live specimens. It creeps me out, but it's survival.

I've been attempting to document my findings. Father says we need to learn how to take advantage of the ecosystem if we're going to survive. To be honest I'm just doing it because I enjoy it. It's not easy without a proper lab and equipment, but the old fashioned way - observing, taking notes, testing theories - reveals things a spectroscopic analysis never would.

Lately I've been watching the sea snakes that live in the purple mushrooms that grow down here. They ambush their prey as it tries to feed on the mushroom. What they don't consume settles on the seabed, which fertilizes the mushrooms, which feed the herbivores, and the chain continues. Co-evolution just blows my mind.",

Plasteel to the Federation... this family operates nine different mining colonies across the Ariadne Arm. Maida thinks she's better suited to lead? Her contract still says otherwise.

But. I just cannot damn tell whether it's the stupidest idea I ever heard, or my only hope. I turned 80 years old last week. I thought I had another 80 in me yet. Stuck here, there's no swapping out my liver when the old one fails. Down here, I'm mortal. Maida is useful to me.

So it's my responsibility to make a decision. Return to the island and hope whatever knocked the Degasi out of the sky won't do the same to the rescue ship, or take us deeper in search of answers. And all the while be hoping old age gets me before the seamonsters do.

I'll give Maida just one thing. She was right about these caves. There's enough lithium here to fabricate a hundred tons of plasteel. Enough for a damn FLEET of cyclops submarines. There was nothing anyone could have done to avoid crashing here, but I was right to order the detour.
